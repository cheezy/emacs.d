= TODO for ERT

short-term:
* Manual (texinfo)
** Install the manual upon compilation?
** Publish the manual as HTML

* Port over some mode-unit assertions
** assert-face-at-point
** assert-overlay
** assert-font-lock

* Results buffer maybe shouldn't begin with a space?
* What's the purpose of empty arg list in ert-deftest?
* Any way to make ert-deftest only increase indentation by 2?
* Automated buffer-management
* Visualize test results as overlays
* Add `skip' feature for tests that can't run in current environment

long-term:
* Submit to GNU Emacs
* Functions to deal with subprocesses
