0.5.9 / 2009-01-21
==================

* Fixed the bug of disabling the auto-indenting of ``cc-mode``.

0.5.8 / 2009-01-15
==================

* Added a ``key`` property in snippet definition for snippet names
  that are not valid path name.
* Fixed some bugs of indenting (`Issue 44
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=44>`_, `Issue
  46 <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=46>`_).
* Fixed `Issue 45
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=45>`_ by
  providing a proper default value for ``yas/buffer-local-condition``.
* Added helper function ``yas/substr`` for convenient mirror
  transformation.
* Make variable ``yas/registered-snippet`` properly initialized.
* Fixed the overlay error when overlay becomes empty (`Issue 49
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=49>`_ and
  `Issue 48
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=48>`_). This
  bug has occurred and been fixed earlier, and should not have
  happened if we have proper regression test.
* Added a workaround for ``c-electric-`` serial commands (`Issue 27
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=27>`_).

0.5.6 / 2008-08-07
==================

* Added a buffer local variable ``yas/dont-activate`` to turn off
  ``yas/minor-mode`` in some major modes. See `Issue 29
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=29>`_.
* Make the environment of elisp evaluation more friendly to
  ``(current-column)``.

  customized.

==================

* Fix indent of python-mode snippets.

0.5.0 / 2008-04-10
==================

* Integrate with hippie-expand. Just add ``yas/hippie-try-expand`` to
  ``hippie-expand-try-functions-list``.
* If you set ``yas/fall-back-behavior`` to ``'return-nil``, YASnippet
  will return nil when it can't find a snippet to expand.
* Defect fix: the condition of a snippet was evaluated twice in
  earlier version.
* Deleting snippet (using ``C-w`` or ``C-k``) won't cause serious
  problem now.

  distribution.

  available online.

0.4.1 / 2008-03-21
==================

* Make sure ``yas/minor-mode``'s key bindings always take priority to
  other minor modes.

0.4.0 / 2008-03-20
==================

* Document refinement and released with YASnippet. Most of the Online
  wiki document will be deprecated soon.
* Powerful condition system added to yasnippet!
* Incorporate ``dropdown-list.el`` and make it default way for
  selecting multiple candidates. Thanks to `Jaeyoun Chung
  <http://groups.google.com/group/smart-snippet/browse_thread/thread/c869158b76addeb3/e7c6372ba457189e>`_.
* yas/before-expand-snippet-hook

0.3.2 / 2008-03-19
==================

* Enhancement: A better way to define minor-mode. Thanks to Kentaro
  Kuribayashi. See `this thread
  <https://groups.google.com/group/smart-snippet/browse_thread/thread/65cb3b5583eda887?hl=en>`_
  for more details.

0.3.1 / 2008-03-17
==================

* Bug fix: Emacs get confused when a field is deleted. See `issue 10
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=10>`_.

0.3.0 / 2008-03-16
==================

* Add a ``yas/after-exit-snippet-hook`` so that you can do something like
  ``indent-region`` or ``fill-region`` after finish the snippet.
* Use minor-mode instead of ``global-set-key`` to bind the trigger
  key. Now the trigger key and fall-back behavior can be more
  flexible. Not constrained to ``<tab>``. Thanks to Trey Jackson. See
  this `thread
  <https://groups.google.com/group/smart-snippet/browse_thread/thread/937f32a2a6dea4f2?hl=en>`_
  for more details.
* Now user can customize the popup function for selecting multiple
  candidate for the same snippet key.

  candidate when in text mode.

0.2.3 / 2008-03-15
==================

* Bug in non-window (-nw) mode when there's multiple candidate to
  expand. See `issue 7

  field. 

0.2.2 / 2008-03-13

  background. And users can customize it.

0.2.1 / 2008-03-10
==================

* Fix the insert-behind problem under both Emacs 22 and Emacs 23. 

0.2.0 / 2008-03-10
==================

* Use big keymap overlay to detect ``insert-behind`` event manually to
  avoid sometimes missed hook calls. See `issue 3
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=3>`_ for more
  details.
* Support parent snippet table. Now you can set (for example)
  ``cc-mode`` as common mode for ``c++-mode``, ``c-mode`` and
  ``java-mode``. They'll share snippets defined for ``cc-mode``.
