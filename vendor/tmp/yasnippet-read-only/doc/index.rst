Yasnippet is a template system for emacs. It allows you to type a
abbrevation and automatically expand the abbreviation into function
templates.

Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby,
SQL, LaTeX, HTML, CSS and more.

Yasnippet system is inspired from TextMate's template system. You can
use `a tool
<https://groups.google.com/group/smart-snippet/browse_thread/thread/691fbdd33412d86e?pli=1>`_
to import any TextMate template you have to Yasnippet. It is a
re-design and re-write of my original extension `smart-snippet`_. It
is much cleaner and more powerful than smart-snippet.

Video Demo
==========

Watch the `demo at YouTube
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOj7btx3ATg>`_ (download a higher
resolution version: `yasnippet.avi
<http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/files/yasnippet.avi>`_).

Brief Install Instruction
=========================

There are two archives of YASnippet. One is a single file compiled
“bundle”, and the other is normal. If all you need is to use the
builtin templates, download the bundle one. If you want to add your
own templates, download the normal one.

Bundle Install
--------------

1. Download the latest ``yasnippet-bundle-x.y.z.el.tgz`` and unpack it.
2. You'll get a file named ``yasnippet-bundle.el``, put it under
   ``~/.emacs.d/plugins/`` (create the directory if not exists).
3. Open the file in Emacs, and type ``Alt+x eval-buffer``.

That's it. Now open any one of your language file, you'll see a menu
YASnippet. you can pull the menu to insert a template. Or, you can
type the pre-defined abbrev and press ``TAB`` to expand it.

To have emacs load YASnippet automatically when it starts, put the
following in your ``~/.emacs`` file:

   .. sourcecode:: common-lisp

     (add-to-list 'load-path
                   "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
     (require 'yasnippet-bundle)

Normal Install
--------------

For full install of the normal archive, just download and unpack the
latest ``yasnippet-x.y.z.tar.bz2``. You'll get a directory named
``yasnippet``, put it in your ``~/.emacs.d/plugins`` and add the
following in your ``.emacs`` file:

   .. sourcecode:: common-lisp

     (add-to-list 'load-path
                   "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
     (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle
     (yas/initialize)
     (yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet/snippets")

Please refer to the documentation for full customization.
